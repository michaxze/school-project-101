        <h1>Have your Business listed to us!</h1>
        
        <p>
        Business directories benefit small, medium, local companies as well 
        as large, international companies. The important thing is that you 
        get your name out there so customers know they can turn to your business. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Online business directories are an inexpensive, effective way to maintain 
        your business's standing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The Cebu Directories Business Directory Listing is organized by categories.  
        Our team handles the placement of the business by category to ensure everything 
        is in place and making things helpful to everyone.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Benefits of Directory Listing</h2>
                
        <h3>More Exposure</h3>
        <p>
        This means more customers. People will not buy your products or use your services if they don't 
        know who you are. It's that simple. Your business directory listing will contain important business 
        information that customers are interested in. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Cheap Advertising Cost</h3>
        <p>
        The cost of running a business is high; advertising costs are high. Listing with an online business 
        directory is a good, inexpensive way to gain exposure for your company. Often the cost is 
        less than that of advertising in the traditional paper yellow pages.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Get Optimization Services</h3>
        <p>
        Depending on the business directory or directories you subscribe to, you may be able to get optimization 
        services. This means that your listing will be enhanced to contain specific keywords that draw better search
        engine rankings.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Good Search Engine Ranking</h3>
        <p>
        Good search engine rankings ensure your company will have increased visibility and traffic. Rank is 
        determined by the number of inbound links to a site. An online business directory lets business owners 
        get these links. The more business directories your business is submitted to, the more inbound links it has. 
        This increases page rankings.
