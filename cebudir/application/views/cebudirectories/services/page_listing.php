                Business directories benefit small, medium, local companies as well 
                as large, international companies. The important thing is that you 
                get your name out there so customers know they can turn to your business. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="medium">
                Online business directories are an inexpensive, effective way to maintain 
                your business's standing.

                The Cebu Directories Business Directory Listing is organized by categories.

                <h3>More Exposure</h3>
                <p class="medium">
                This means more customers. People will not buy 
				your products or use your services if they don't 
				know who you are. It's that simple. Your business 
				directory listing will contain important business 
				information that customers are interested in. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Cheap Advertising Cost</h3>
                <p class="medium">
                The cost of running a business is high; advertising 
                costs are high. Listing with an online business 
                directory is a good, inexpensive way to gain 
                exposure for your company. Often the cost is 
                less than that of advertising in the traditional 
                paper yellow pages.

                <h3>Get Optimization Services</h3>
                <p class="medium">
                Depending on the business directory or directories 
                you subscribe to, you may be able to get optimization 
                services. This means that your listing will be enhanced 
                to contain specific keywords that draw better search
                engine rankings.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Good Search Engine Ranking</h3>
                <p class="medium">
                Good search engine rankings ensure your company 
                will have increased visibility and traffic. Rank is 
                determined by the number of inbound links to a site. 
                An online business directory lets business owners 
                get these links. The more business directories your 
                business is submitted to, the more inbound links it has. 
                This increases page rankings.
