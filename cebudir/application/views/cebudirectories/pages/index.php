                Magellan's Cross is a Christian cross planted by Portuguese, and Spanish  
                explorers as ordered by Ferdinand Magellan upon arriving in Cebu in the 
                Philippines  on April 21, 1521.

                <p class="small">
                This cross is housed in a chapel next to the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni&ntilde;o 
                on Magallanes Street (Magallanes being the Spanish name of Magellan), just in 
                front of the city hall of Cebu City. A sign below the cross describes the original 
                cross is encased inside the wooden cross that is found in the center of the chapel. 
                This is to protect the original cross from people who chipped away parts of the 
                cross for souvenir purposes or in the belief that the cross possesses miraculous 
                powers. Some people, however, believe that the original cross had been destroyed 
                or had disappeared after Magellan's death, and the cross is a replica that was planted 
                there by the Spaniards after they successfully colonized the Philippines.

                Spanish soldiers, and Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in the Battle of Mactan on 1521.

                <p class="small">
                Built in 1972, the Cebu Taoist Temple is located in Beverly Hills Subdivision in Cebu City. 
                The temple was built by Cebu's substantial  Chinese community. With an elevation of 300 
                meters above sea level,the temple is a towering, multi-tiered, multi-hued attraction 
                accessible by three separate winding routes.
                </p>
                
                <p class="small">
                Unlike the neighboring Phu Sian Temple, the Taoist  temple is open to the worshipers 
                and non-worshipers alike. A ritual among devotees is where one prays to the gods to grant 
                one's wish. The ritual includes washing of hands, going inside the chapel barefoot and 
                dropping two blocks of wood. If the blocks of wood are both face up then one could make 
                a wish. If not then it is not yet the time for one's wish to be granted and one has to 
                come to the temple some other time.

                <p class="small">
                One of the best known landmarks in Lilo-an is its historic lighthouse at Bagacay Point. 
                The original lighthouse was built in 1857 by the Spanish. However, the current tower was 
                constructed in 1904 by order of William Howard Taft, the first Governor-General of 
                the Philippines and later the President of the United States. The tower is 72 feet tall 
                and remains in active use today.
